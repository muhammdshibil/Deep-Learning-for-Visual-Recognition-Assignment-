# Deep-Learning-for-Visual-Recognition-Assignment-
In this repository, you'll find Python scripts implementing fundamental concepts in deep learning and signal processing. The main functionalities include:

Neural Network Architecture Builder:

Python function to construct a neural network architecture based on user input for the number of neurons in the input layer, number of hidden layers, and neurons in each hidden layer.
Computes the output of each hidden layer using sigmoid activation function.
Provides information on weight matrix dimensions, input vector dimensions, and output dimensions for each hidden layer.
2D Convolution Implementation:

Python functions to perform 2D convolution operations with options for 'full', 'valid', and 'same' padding.
Implemented without using direct built-in functions available in Python.
Validation against MATLAB's conv2 function output for accuracy.
These implementations serve as educational tools to understand and implement basic deep learning algorithms, supporting the learning objectives of understanding state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in visual recognition and implementing basic deep learning algorithms.
